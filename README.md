# SimpleNeuralNetTest

So years ago I got interested in programming because I read about neural networks. This is my first serious attempt at writing one from scratch...

## Next steps
1. Make it easier to load values with expected output
2. Change weight adjustment to have option of using total weight, gradient etc (as if I have any idea what I'm talking about :)
2. Ability to load and save network training (weights)
